# Banking Application API

## Description

   The Banking App API is a Server-side application that facilitates the management of Client's Bank Accounts. A client create new accounts of various categories. Clients can deposit or withdraw funds from the account as well as close out accounts.
   
   
## Tech Stack
- Used Python/Flask to create the API.
- PostgreSQL as the RDBMS
- Postman for testing our API through http requests
- Pytest for unittesting purposes
	
## I looked at these requirements before starting the project.
1. All endpoints listed below must have a Postman test verifying functionality
2. Data is stored in a database.
3. Data Access is performed through the use of Data Access Objects.
5. All input is sent from a client (Postman) and handled by the Server
6. Logging is implemented throughout the application
7. All DAO and Service methods must have a test proving that they work
